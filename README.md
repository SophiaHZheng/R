# R-exercise

This repository includes my exercises of R programming in classes or online courses. 

The files starting with 'Exercise' are mostly basic practices when learning R.

The others are advanced exercises, such as estalishing functions to conduct statistical analysis, 
building up statistical modelings to answer real word problems.
